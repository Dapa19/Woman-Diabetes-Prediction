# Woman Diabetes Prediction System
## Project Overview
This project is a Logistic Regression-based system designed to predict whether a woman has diabetes based on several health parameters. The system is built using Python, and the front end is developed with a simple web interface to input the health data and visualize the prediction results.

# Features
- Input health data such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and more.
- Predict the likelihood of having diabetes.
- Display the prediction results, including the probability of having or not having diabetes.
- Simple and user-friendly web interface.

# Technologies Used
- Python: For building the machine learning model (Logistic Regression).
- Flask: For developing the web application.
- HTML/CSS & Bootstrap: For creating the user interface.
- Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration and model training.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For building the Logistic Regression model.

# Dataset
The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and others.
